# BTL Computer Vision: Object Detection on Fisheye Images

A project for the Computer Vision course at the **University of Transport and Communications**.

## 🎯 Objective

This project tackles the challenge of object detection in fisheye camera images, which suffer from severe optical distortion that warps the shape of objects.

---

## 🚀 Key Solutions

* Analysis, comparison, and training of SOTA (State-of-the-art) architectures, including **YOLOv8** and **YOLOv11**.
* Implementation of an **Ensemble** technique using **Weighted Boxes Fusion (WBF)** to combine the strengths of the trained models.
* The final goal is to optimize the mAP and F1-score metrics on the fisheye image dataset.
